      <p class="text-justify"> I completed my Ph.D. from Electrical and Computer engineering department at Rice University in April 2018. At Rice, I was part of the <a href="http://sh.rice.edu/" target="_blank">Scalable Health</a>)  lab and <a href="https://computationalimaging.rice.edu/" target='_blank'> Computational Imaging lab </a>. I did my my Ph.D.  in computer vision and computational imaging with special focus on health applications.  At Rice, I worked with <a href="http://www.ece.rice.edu/~ashu/" target="_blank">Dr. Ashu Sabharwal</a> and <a href="https://www.ece.rice.edu/~av21/" target="_black"> Dr. Ashok Veeraraghavan </a> and actively collaborated with <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people/view/james-suliburk-m-d-facs/b264d8d6-ffed-11e2-be68-080027880ca6" target="_blank">Dr. James Suliburk </a> at Baylor College of Medicine for translation of new medical technologies into clinical practice. After Rice, I joined <a href="https://www.gausssurgical.com/" target="_blank">  Gauss Surgical Inc. </a> where I lead the computer vision (CV) and artificial intelligence (AI) research team to develop AI-enabled platform for real-time monitoring of surgical blood loss, asset tracking, and patient monitoring in the operating room. </p>

      <p class="text-justify"> <b> Ph.D. research: </b> As part of my Ph.D. research, I have developed a new camera-based non-invasive and clinically proven blood flow imaging modality, named PulseCam, that can reliably measure the flow of blood (microcirculation) underneath the skin surface from only the video recording of the skin surface. PulseCam has potential clinical applications in surgery, critical care and as a point-of-care device to diagnose peripheral arterial disease, and to monitor wounds and burns. PulseCam has already been evaluated to monitor microcirculation in patients undergoing surgery, and is currently being considered for potential commercialization. </p>


      

 	 <p class="text-justify"> <b> Research interests: </b> My research interest is in developing health monitoring systems that can reliably and continuously measure people's health at the comfort of their homes and offices, e.g., by utilizing cameras, wearables, and implantables.   I also have a keen interest in predictive machine learning and deep learning algorithms that can model the state of a person's health as it evolves so that we can provide actionable feedback to the individual and the caregiver to improve health outcomes. </p>
