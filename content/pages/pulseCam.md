## The Problem

<p class="text-justify"> Measuring peripheral blood perfusion, i.e. the flow of blood to end-organs and tissue through the blood vessels, has widespread clinical applications such as assessment of wounds and burns, diagnosing peripheral arterial disease (especially in patients suffering from diabetes), monitoring micro-circulation to identify shock in critical care, and for monitoring blood flow at surgical sites, e.g. during plastic surgeries and surgical revascularization procedures. Popular clinical markers of local or peripheral perfusion such as center-to-toe temperature difference, skin mottling and capillary refill time are subjective indicators that lack the required sensitivity and specificity to identify patients with compromised peripheral perfusion. Moreover, contact-based optical modalities such as Laser Doppler Flowmetry, Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), and pulse oximeter that are routinely used in clinical practice can only measure blood flow and hemoglobin related parameters at a specific location on the skin surface, i.e., at the point-of-contact, and their measurements are sensitive to the exact placement of the probe. The high spatial variability in blood perfusion across tissue such as the skin limits the clinical utility of such single point contact-based modalities. </p> 




## Our Solution

<p class="text-justify"> We develop PulseCam, a new camera-based blood perfusion imaging modality that enables clinicians and surgeons to visualize real-time, accurate, three-dimensional spatio-temporal maps of pulsatile blood perfusion underneath the skin surface using only the video of the skin surface or internal tissue. PulseCam achieves 2-3x higher sensitivity compared to the current standard of care in perfusion measurement. In contrast to existing methods that only provide a single point estimate of blood perfusion, PulseCam provides quantitative spatio-temporal blood pulsation maps achieving 1 mm spatial resolution and 1 frame-per-second temporal resolution. PulseCam achieves all these using only a video recording from a standard camera and pulse recording from a standard pulse oximeter as input making the system orders of magnitude cheaper than alternatives such as infrared thermography and Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging.  </p>

<p class="justify"> We have evaluated PulseCam both in a lab setting as well as in a clinical context. We demonstrate that: (i) PulseCam-derived pulsatile perfusion estimates can easily detect arterial and venous blood flow occlusion that is difficult to identify using existing modalities, e.g. using perfusion index measured using a pulse oximeter, (ii) has at least two times better sensitivity and three times better response time in detecting blood flow occlusion compared to an infrared thermal camera, and (ii) is robust and reliable in an operationally challenging surgery-room setting where PulseCam is evaluated in a clinical setting during a surgery in which general anesthesia is used.  Overall, PulseCam represents a new paradigm in low-cost and easy-to-use blood perfusion imaging system providing a holistic view of a patient's hemodynamic state in real-time. We anticipate that PulseCam will be used both at the bedside as well as a point-of-care blood perfusion imaging device to visualize and analyze blood perfusion in an easy-to-use and cost-effective manner.</p>

We use manual pressure cuff to incrementally occlude the blood flow with 10 mmHg, 20 mmHg . . . 100 mmHg occlusion pressure. PulseCam can easily detect blood perfusion changes due to even 10-20 mmHg occlusion pressure difference that is difficult to identify using existing modalities. </p>

			<p class="text-center">The video shows the blood perfusion map in the palm of a patient undergoing surgery in which general anesthesia is used. Anesthesia induction is known to cause an increase in peripheral blood perfusion. PulseCam can easily detect an increase in blood perfusion in the palm just after anesthesia induction. Also, PulseCam can recover these perfusion changes in a challenging clinical setting.</p>
