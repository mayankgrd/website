**High-resolution blood perfusion imaging using a camera and a pulse oximeter** 

<div class="container">
	<div class="row clearfix">
		<div class="col-md-8 column">
		<p class="text-justify">PulseCam is a new camera-based blood perfusion imaging modality that enables clinicians and surgeons to visualize real-time, accurate, three-dimensional spatio-temporal maps of pulsatile blood perfusion underneath the skin surface using only the video of the skin surface or internal tissue. PulseCam achieves 2-3x higher sensitivity compared to the current standard of care in perfusion measurement. In contrast to existing methods that only provide a single point estimate of blood perfusion, PulseCam provides quantitative spatio-temporal blood pulsation maps achieving 1 mm spatial resolution and 1 frame-per-second temporal resolution. PulseCam achieves all these using only a video recording from a standard camera and pulse recording from a standard pulse oximeter as input making the system orders of magnitude cheaper than alternatives such as infrared thermography and Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging. </p>

**Robust non-contact vital signs monitoring using a camera** 

<div class="container">
	<div class="row clearfix">
		<div class="col-md-8 column">
		<p class="text-justify"><b>CameraVitals</b> is a camera-based photoplethysmogram (PPG) estimation algorithm. DistancePPG address two major challenges in camera-based vital sign monitoring: (i) extremely low signal strength of PPG signal, particularly for people with darker skin tones, and/or under low lighting conditions, (ii) motion artifacts due to movement of a person in front of a camera. DistancePPG proposes a new method of combining skin-color change signals from different regions of the face using a weighted average, where the weights depend on the blood perfusion and incident light intensity in the region, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of camera-based PPG estimate. The gains in SNR of camera-based PPG estimated using distancePPG translate into reduction of the error in vital sign estimation, and thus expand the scope of camera-based vital sign monitoring to potentially new scenarios. </p>

### ScaleMed ###
**A Platform for at-Scale mHealth Research and Development** 


<div class="container">
<div class="row clearfix">
<div class="col-md-8 column">
		<p class="text-justify"> ScaleMed is an end-to-end platform being developed at Rice University for conducting at-scale mHealth research and development. ScaleMed is specifically targeted towards mobile health diagnostic and measurement applications, and focuses on the information technology piece of scaling mobile health trials. ScaleMed has three key components: </p>

		<ol> 
		<li> <b>Medical App Modules, Libraries, and Templates</b>: These  modules and libraries help quickly develop mhealth research apps on smartphones by abstracting out few standard steps e.g. bluetooth connectivity, sensor data storage, basic UI, connecting to cloud for data-sync. We are also developing scenario specific template apps which can be easily extended for particular use.  
		<li> <b>Cloud control and management </b>: Central data synchronization and control is a critical component of any mid or large-scale health-care trial. Thus, we will be developing a ScaleMed cloud which connects to all ScaleMed nodes (smartphone/tablets), and provides central command, control, storage and management for the whole network of nodes used in a particular study. 
		<li> <b> Hardware Adaptor </b>: The hardware adaptor is designed to help researchers easiily integrate connectivity (e.g. bluetooth) into their custom sensor design so that  they can take advantage of ScaleMed smartphone libraries and the ScaleMed cloud.  
		</ol>
