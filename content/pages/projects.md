### DistancePPG ###
**Robust non-contact vital signs monitoring using a camera** 

**DistancePPG** is a photoplethysmogram (PPG) estimation algorithm which address two major challenges in camera-based vital sign monitoring: (i) extremely low signal strength of PPG signal, particularly for people with darker skin tones, and/or under low lighting conditions, (ii) motion artifacts due to movement of a person in front of a camera. DistancePPG proposes a new method of combining skin-color change signals from different regions of the face using a weighted average, where the weights depend on the blood perfusion and incident light intensity in the region, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of camera-based PPG estimate. The gains in SNR of camera-based PPG estimated using distancePPG translate into reduction of the error in vital sign estimation, and thus expand the scope of camera-based vital sign monitoring to potentially new scenarios.
