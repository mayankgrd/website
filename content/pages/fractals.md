A fractal is a never ending pattern. Fractals are infinite complex pattern that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursions, fractals are images of dynamic systems --- the picture of chaos. 

Geometrically, fractals exhibit fractional dimensions, they exist in between our familiar euclidean dimensions like line (dime $1$), square (dim: $2$), cube (dim: $3$) . E.g. *[Sierpinski Triangle](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SierpinskiSieve.html)* has dimension of $1.585$. Weird??? <mark>[This](http://math.rice.edu/~lanius/fractals/dim.html) </mark> article provides an intuitive way of understanding fractional dimensions, and why fractals exhibit fractional dimensions. 

You can find fractals all over the natural world, from tiny patterns like seashells up to the giant spirals of the galaxies. Trees, river networks, mountains, coastlines, lightning bolts, blood vessels, flowers, etc are all examples of natural fractals. You can look at a fractal as a picture that tells a story of the natural processes that formed it.

## Fractals and Hindu Temples

Indian and Southeast Asian temples and monuments exhibit a fractal structure: the main tower (*shikhar*) has rings of self-similar shapes in progressively smaller size (scaling) rising up to $n=10$ or $20$ levels. Even the main tower is surrounded by many more smaller towers, each having smaller scale, but similar in structure to the main tower (*shikhar*). You can see few examples <mark>[here](https://classes.yale.edu/fractals/Panorama/Architecture/IndianArch/IndianArch.html)</mark>.

A Hindu temple can be considered as a symbolic structure that represent certain fundamental concepts of Hindu philosophy, and a formal characteristics of this temple (also known as *Vastu*) are an outcome of this symbolic representation. William Jackson tried to express this relationship between Hindu philosophy/cosmology and temple architecture rather succinctly in his quote

> "The ideal form gracefully artificed suggests the infinite rising levels of existence and consciousness, expanding sizes rising toward transcendence above, and at the same time housing the sacred deep within."

and, 
>"This universe is like a ripe fruit appearing from the activity of the cit [consciousness]. There is a branch of a tree bearing innumerable such fruit. There is a tree having thousands of such branches. There is a forest with thousands of such trees. There is a mountainous territory having thousands of such forests. There is a territory containing thousands of such territories. There is a solar system containing thousands of such territories. There is a universe containing thousands of such solar systems. And there are many such universes contained within what is like an atom within an atom. This is what is known as cit or the subtle sun which illumines everything in the world. All the things of the world take their rise in it. Amidst all this incessant activity, the cit is ever in undisturbed repose."

If you are interested in this linkage between fractals and, Hindu philosophy and *Vastu Shastra*, <mark>[this](http://www.akashfoundation.com/Articals/Hindu_Temple_Models.pdf)</mark> might be a good place to start.
